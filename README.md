A vulnerability scanner, often referred to as a vulnscan, is a tool designed to identify and assess vulnerabilities within a system or network. Here’s a step-by-step understanding of how it operates and what it entails:

Purpose: The main aim of a vulnerability scanner is to discover weaknesses in software systems, configurations, and network setups that could be exploited by attackers.

Scanning Process:

The scanner examines each open port and the associated services.
It often retrieves service banners, which contain information about the software version running on that port. This is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities.
Utilization of Vulnerability Lists:

The scanner can compare the retrieved banners against known vulnerability databases or lists to determine if any software versions are outdated or have known exploits.
You can source these lists from the internet, including repositories like GitHub or manually create them.
Detection of Vulnerabilities:

If the banner from a scanned service matches an entry in the vulnerability list, the scanner flags the corresponding software as vulnerable.
This detection process doesn't indicate that all software capturing a banner is necessarily vulnerable; it is contingent upon known vulnerabilities associated with that version.
Implementation:

Users are typically encouraged to create customized lists of vulnerable software to improve the effectiveness of their scans.
The approach may vary slightly in implementation, using different methods to check for matches—like exact comparisons or keyword searches within banners.
